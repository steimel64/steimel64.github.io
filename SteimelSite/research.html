        <!-- Outside CSS Frameworks Used- Normalize/Grid
        Normalize- Helps with rendering of elements to be more consistent
        Grid- Grid is useful as it uses a grid system to help align elements;
        for example classes of "col span-1-of-2" would create grid elements of approximately half the page width- 
        This was used solely for alignment although I am still a beginner at using it-->

                    <h3>Applied Machine Learning</h3>
                    I'm interested in learning about how businesses are 
                    applying Machine Learning in our everyday lives. Many companies 
                    nowadays have achieved competitive advantage in this digital age through the use of
                    machine learning in everyday business processes.

                    <h3>Machine Learning and Technology for Sustainability</h3>
                    As a master's student at Sophia University studying Green Science and Engineering with a dual diploma in Sustainability Science 
                    from United Nations University. I have the opportunity to take classes related to Machine Learning and Sustainability Science. 
                    I feel this cross-disciplinarity is key to solving the complex problems of the future. I always find myself thinking about how Machine Learning could make the world a better place.   
                    I am interested in understanding and applying Machine Learning to promote sustainability and smarter cities. 
                    <br> <br>

                    <h3>Deep Learning for Music</h3>
                    In my undergraduate days I studied music composition/classical guitar 
                    and have been a musician as long as I can remember. I have also been studying Machine Learning and recently Deep Learning has been applied to music and art generation.
                    In the future, I hope to combine my passion for music and research Deep Learning methods applied to music generation so that I can augment my own abilities as a guitarist/composer.

# Data Science Portfolio by Bill Steimel

This portfolio is a compilation of notebooks which I created for data analysis or for exploration of machine learning algorithms. Any experience relevant to Data Science is also listed in this portfolio. 

## Classification problems.

### Iris Classification: Decision Tree Techniques (Python)
[Github](https://github.com/steimel64/steimel64.github.io/blob/master/Notebooks/Iris%20Notebook.ipynb) 

As quoted from the Kaggle description for this dataset, the Iris dataset was used in Fishers classic 1936 paper, “The Use of Multiple Measurements in Taxonomic Problems”. 
The Iris dataset is a famous dataset often used by Machine Learning students to develop their understanding of classification problems.The dataset contains 4 features which include the Sepal Length, Sepal Width, Petal Length, and Petal Width. These features are used to predict or classify the predictions into three species of Iris including the Iris-setosa, Iris-Versicolor, and Iris-Virginica.
I decided to practice Decision Tree Algorithms with this dataset to increase my practical understanding of the algorithm as well as its prediction behavior.

## Regression problems.

### House Prices: Decision Tree Techniques (Python) 
[Github](https://github.com/steimel64/steimel64.github.io/blob/master/Notebooks/Boston%20Housing%20Notebook.ipynb)

The Boston Housing Prices dataset is a famous dataset also often used by Machine Learning students to develop their understanding of regression problems. The dataset contains 506 observations and 13 predictive features. These features are used to predict the median housing value in neighborhoods in the Boston Suburbs which can have heavy applications to real estate pricing. 
I decided to practice Regression Decision Tree Algorithms with this dataset to increase my practical understanding of the algorithm as well as its predictive behavior.

### Wine Quality Prediction: Regression Techniques (Python) 
[Github](https://github.com/steimel64/steimel64.github.io/blob/master/Notebooks/Wine.ipynb)

Wine is increasingly being enjoyed by consumers all around the globe. Quality is a very important factor for all consumers when choosing a product and thus a very important factor for finding the ideal wine to purchase.
Wouldn't it be interesting to be able to predict wine quality through some of its psyicochemical attributes? This project seeks to develop a model that helps the wine industry predict a wines quality through these factors with the most accuracy. For the purpose of this analysis, I will be utilizing the red wine dataset of Portugal to predict wine quality based on their physicochemical features.
 
I decided to practice new techniques like Cross-Validation and Hyperparameter tuning for this end-to-end Machine Learning project to improve my practical understanding of these techniques.

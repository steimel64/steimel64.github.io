        Normalize- Helps with rendering of elements to be more consistent
        Grid- Grid is useful as it uses a grid system to help align elements;
        for example classes of "col span-1-of-2" would create grid elements of approximately half the page width- 
        This was used solely for alignment although I am still a beginner at using it-->

                <div class="col span-3-of-6">
                    <p> My name is William Steimel (Billy) and im currently a master's student studying Machine Learning with Miyamoto Lab at Sophia University in Tokyo. 
                        I'm currently loving life in Tokyo as everyday is a new adventure and challenge. As a part of the Green Science and Engineering program at Sophia University with a joint Diploma in Sustainability Science from United Nations University, I am given 
                        the unique opportunity to study Sustainability and Machine Learning in combination. </p>
                    <br> 
                    <p>I have worked in data analytics for nearly 10 years in the public, private, and non-profit sector where I have always delivered immediate insight into business problems through
                       advanced data analytics and contemporary visualization methods. 
                       In the future, I'm hoping to blend my academic training, technical experience, and global perspective 
                       to develop analysis systems and extract meaning from large-scale data. Also, I'm hoping to use my service delivery oriented background 
                       to contribute to sustainable business operations and help address the demands of the modern century. </p>
                    <p>
                    <br>
                       On the side, I am very passionate about music and also currently working on a project to develop AI generated music. During my free time you can find me either on Kaggle or playing my guitar !

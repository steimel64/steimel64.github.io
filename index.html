        for example classes of "col span-1-of-2" would create grid elements of approximately half the page width-

                            <br>
                            <p><b>Abstract: </b>Rent prediction and real estate value estimation has long had applications in economics, urban development, and public policy. 
                                Recently machine learning techniques have been applied to real estate value estimation in the private sector and competitive machine learning competitions with good results. 
                                However, there are some challenges with modeling real estate prices due to the amount of factors that contribute to the overall market which can vary based on geographic region. 
                                Tokyo, like any other major city in the world has common but also unique factors that contribute to rent pricing and valuation. 
                                This paper introduces an approach that uses Gradient Boosting Decision Tree (GBDT) algorithm LightGBM (LGBM) to predict rent in Tokyo's 23 special wards based on real estate, geospatial, and environmental features. 
                                This approach achieves performance gains through the combination of environmental data sources and feature engineering techniques in comparison to a baseline model that only uses rental features. 
                                The proposed model achieves price predictions within 5.01 % and 11,200 yen which is an improvement on the baseline model's error of 5.91 % and 12,200 yen. 
                                This paper also explores the factors that contribute to rent value in Tokyoâ€™s 23 wards based on LightGBM's optimization from an environmental, geospatial, and feature engineering perspective.</p>

                                Convolutional Neural Network in Keras. This notebook utilizes a dataset from the National 
                                Diet Library (NDL Lab) that contains 60,000 images of 73 drawn hiragana characters. 
                                Character recognition or classification is becoming increasingly important and this 
                                project was a fun way to combine my interest in Japanese Language with an 
                                introduction to Convolutional Neural Networks.</p>

                    <br>
                    <p>Credit Fraud is a huge problem that we are all familiar with whether we have experienced it or not and 
                        a huge concern among consumers. This project seeks to develop a model
                        that helps the financial industry predict whether a transaction is
                        considered a fraud or not based on anonymized transactional features. 
                        I decided to undertake this project as I thought it would be interesting to be able to predict fraud with Machine Learning 
                        and Logistic Regression. I also wanted to further study oversampling techniques 
                        like SMOTE with a practical example.

                        <p>As part of my coursework, I was fortunate to be able to participate in a fellowship and seminar for one year at the United Nations. Through these programs, I attended and contributed to weekly conferences held by the UN Department of Public Information, various diplomats, and experts in their fields. 
                           After 6 months in the program, I was appointed as NGO representative to the United Nations Department of Public Information for Felician College. This experience allowed me to serve as a youth leader for the college and represent my university at weekly briefings at the United Nations Headquarters on topics such as corporate social responsibility, environmental sustainability, human rights, poverty, and economic crisis.  </p>

                    <p> During my time at Felician University, I initially studied Music Composition and Classical guitar with around 2 years of music coursework. 
                        Eventually I also found my passion for data analysis. I decided at that point to major in Business Administration where I focused on Data Analysis and business analytics. 
                        I also became interested in social justice issues and took on a minor in Global Peace and Justice studies which allowed me the opportunity to perform coursework with the United Nations. 
                        Felician University was a great time for me to experiment and discover myself which has set me up on this current path.

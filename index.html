        Normalize- Helps with rendering of elements to be more consistent
        Grid- Grid is useful as it uses a grid system to help align elements;
        for example classes of "col span-1-of-2" would create grid elements of approximately half the page width- 
        This was used solely for alignment although I am still a beginner at using it-->

                                Convolutional Neural Network in Keras. This notebook utilizes a dataset from the National

                                Character recognition or classification is becoming increasingly important and this

                    <p>Credit Fraud is a huge problem that we are all familiar with whether we have experienced it or not and 
                        a huge concern among consumers. This project seeks to develop a model
                        that helps the financial industry predict whether a transaction is
                        considered a fraud or not based on anonymized transactional features. 
                        I decided to undertake this project as I thought it would be interesting to be able to predict fraud with Machine Learning 
                        and Logistic Regression. I also wanted to further study oversampling techniques 
                        like SMOTE with a practical example.

                        Eventually I also found my passion for data analysis. I decided at that point to major in Business Administration where I focused on Data Analysis and business analytics. 
                        I also became interested in social justice issues and took on a minor in Global Peace and Justice studies which allowed me the opportunity to perform coursework with the United Nations. 
                        Felician University was a great time for me to experiment and discover myself which has set me up on this current path.

# Data Science Portfolio by Bill Steimel

This portfolio is a compilation of notebooks which I created for data analysis or for exploration of machine learning algorithms. Any experience relevant to Data Science is also listed in this portfolio. I am currently working on research related to Deep Learning for Music Generation as part of my Masters thesis which can also be found here.  

## Classification problems.

### Iris Classification: Decision Tree Techniques (Python)
[Github](https://github.com/steimel64/steimel64.github.io/blob/master/Notebooks/Iris%20Notebook.ipynb) 

As quoted from the Kaggle description for this dataset, the Iris dataset was used in Fishers classic 1936 paper, “The Use of Multiple Measurements in Taxonomic Problems”. 
The Iris dataset is a famous dataset often used by Machine Learning students to develop their understanding of classification problems.The dataset contains 4 features which include the Sepal Length, Sepal Width, Petal Length, and Petal Width. These features are used to predict or classify the predictions into three species of Iris including the Iris-setosa, Iris-Versicolor, and Iris-Virginica.
I decided to practice Decision Tree Algorithms with this dataset to increase my practical understanding of the algorithm as well as its prediction behavior.

##### Keywords: Decision Tree, RandomForest, Classification, Supervised Learning

### Credit Fraud Detection: Logistic Regression / SMOTE Oversampling (Python)
[Github](https://github.com/steimel64/steimel64.github.io/blob/master/Notebooks/Fraud%20Analysis.ipynb) 

Credit Fraud is a huge problem that we are all familiar with whether we have experienced it or not and a huge concern among consumers. This project seeks to develop a model that helps the financial industry predict whether a transaction is considered a fraud or not based on anonymized transactional features. I decided to undertake this project as I thought it would be interesting to be able to predict fraud with Machine Learning and Logistic Regression. I also wanted to further study oversampling techniques like SMOTE with a practical example.

##### Keywords: Logistic Regression, Classification, Supervised Learning, Imbalanced Classification, SMOTE Oversampling 



## Regression problems.

### House Prices: Decision Tree Techniques (Python) 
[Github](https://github.com/steimel64/steimel64.github.io/blob/master/Notebooks/Boston%20Housing%20Notebook.ipynb)

The Boston Housing Prices dataset is a famous dataset also often used by Machine Learning students to develop their understanding of regression problems. The dataset contains 506 observations and 13 predictive features. These features are used to predict the median housing value in neighborhoods in the Boston Suburbs which can have heavy applications to real estate pricing. 
I decided to practice Regression Decision Tree Algorithms with this dataset to increase my practical understanding of the algorithm as well as its predictive behavior.
##### Keywords: Decision Tree, Random Forest, Regression, Supervised Learning

### Kings County Housing Prices: Decision Tree/Random Forest (Python) 
[Github](https://github.com/steimel64/steimel64.github.io/blob/master/Notebooks/SeattleHousing.ipynb)

The Kings County Housing Prices dataset is a dataset similar to the well known Boston Housing Prices dataset with a bit more feature complexity. This dataset contains house sale prices for King County, which includes Seattle. It also includes homes sold between May 2014 and May 2015. The goal of this project is to predict housing prices in King's County based on various house features. 

##### Keywords: Decision Tree, Random Forest, Regression, Supervised Learning


### Wine Quality Prediction: Regression Techniques (Python) 
[Github](https://github.com/steimel64/steimel64.github.io/blob/master/Notebooks/Wine.ipynb)

Wine is increasingly being enjoyed by consumers all around the globe. Quality is a very important factor for all consumers when choosing a product and thus a very important factor for finding the ideal wine to purchase.
Wouldn't it be interesting to be able to predict wine quality through some of its psyicochemical attributes? This project seeks to develop a model that helps the wine industry predict a wines quality through these factors with the most accuracy. For the purpose of this analysis, I will be utilizing the red wine dataset of Portugal to predict wine quality based on their physicochemical features.
 
I decided to practice new techniques like Cross-Validation and Hyperparameter tuning for this end-to-end Machine Learning project to improve my practical understanding of these techniques. 

##### Keywords: Linear Regression, Random Forest, Regression, Cross-Validation, Hyperparameter Tuning, GridSearch, Supervised Learning


## Natural language processing

### Spam Prediction: Naive Bayes Classifier/Bag Of Words (Python) 
[Github](https://github.com/steimel64/steimel64.github.io/blob/master/Notebooks/NaiveBayesSpam.ipynb)

This project seeks to develop a model that can predict whether an e-mail is considered spam or ham (normal) with the Naive Bayes Classifier and Bag of Words model. Naive Bayes Classifiers have been traditionally good at e-mail filtering and this notebook covers many topics like how to build a Machine Learning Model, Data Exploration, Data Cleaning, Text Preprocessing for NLP Data, Model Training, and Evaluation. 

##### Keywords: Naive Bayes, Bag Of Words, Classification, Supervised Learning

## Recommender Systems
[Github](https://github.com/steimel64/steimel64.github.io/blob/master/Notebooks/Anime%20Recommender/Recommender.ipynb)

My animelist.net is a popular site for viewing Anime online which is self proclaimed as the world's most active online anime and manga community and database. The Anime Recommendations database provided by animelist.net contains user review data from 76,000 users and wouldn't it be cool to generate some Recommendations based on this data? 

In this notebook I practiced building my first Collaborative Filtering Recommender System in Python with the K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm with pretty decent results. 

##### Keywords: Collaborative Filtering, K-Nearest Neighbors, Recommender Systems


## Clustering
Coming Soon! 

## Neural networks

### Hiragana Character Recognition with Keras and OpenCV (Python) 
[Github](https://github.com/steimel64/steimel64.github.io/blob/master/Notebooks/HiraganaRecognition.ipynb)

This project seeks to build a model that recognizes hiragana characters with a Convolutional Neural Network in Keras. This notebook utilizes a dataset from the National Diet Library (NDL Lab) that contains 60,000 images of 73 drawn hiragana characters. Character recognition or classification is becoming increasingly important and this project was a fun way to combine my interest in Japanese Language with an introduction to Convolutional Neural Networks. 

##### Keywords: Keras, CNN, Classification, Supervised Learning 

## Data exploration and analysis

### Data Visualization/Exploration Project: Global Terrorism (Python) 
[Github](https://github.com/steimel64/steimel64.github.io/blob/master/Notebooks/Terrorism/Terrorism.ipynb)

The dataset comes from the Global Terrorism Database which details more than 170,000 terrorist attacks worldwide between 1970 and 2016.This project seeks to explore, visualize, and analyze terrorism Trends from a global perspective as well as from the perspective of Japan and the United States. I was able to apply various techniques for data exploration and map visualizations through Python. 

##### Keywords: Data Visualization, Data Exploration, Matplotlib, Seaborn

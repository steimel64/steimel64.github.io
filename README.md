# Data Science Portfolio by Bill Steimel (WIP)

This portfolio is a compilation of notebooks which I created for data analysis or for exploration of machine learning algorithms. Any experience relevant to Data Science is also listed in this portfolio. 

## Classification problems.

Banks strive to increase the efficiency of their contacts with customers. One of the areas which require this is offering new products to existing clients (cross-selling). Instead of offering new products to all clients, it is a good idea to predict the probability of a positive response. Then the offers could be sent to those clients, for whom the probability of response is higher than some threshold value.
In this notebook I try to solve this problem.

## Natural language processing.

## Clustering

## Neural networks

## Data exploration and analysis

## Data Science for Business Intelligence Techniques

## Masters Data Science Presentations

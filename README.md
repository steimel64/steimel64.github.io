# Data Science Portfolio by Bill Steimel

This portfolio is a compilation of notebooks which I created for data analysis or for exploration of machine learning algorithms. Any experience relevant to Data Science is also listed in this portfolio. 

## Classification problems.

### Iris Classification: Decision Tree Techniques (Python)
[Github](https://github.com/steimel64/steimel64.github.io/blob/master/Notebooks/Iris%20Notebook.ipynb) 

As quoted from the Kaggle description for this dataset, the Iris dataset was used in Fishers classic 1936 paper, “The Use of Multiple Measurements in Taxonomic Problems”. 
The Iris dataset is a famous dataset often used by Machine Learning students to develop their understanding of classification problems.The dataset contains 4 features which include the Sepal Length, Sepal Width, Petal Length, and Petal Width. These features are used to predict or classify the predictions into three species of Iris including the Iris-setosa, Iris-Versicolor, and Iris-Virginica.
I decided to practice Decision Tree Algorithms with this dataset to increase my practical understanding of the algorithm as well as its prediction behavior.

## Regression problems.

### House Prices: Decision Tree Techniques (Python) 
[Github](https://github.com/steimel64/steimel64.github.io/blob/master/Notebooks/Boston%20Housing%20Notebook.ipynb)

The Boston Housing Prices dataset is a famous dataset also often used by Machine Learning students to develop their understanding of regression problems. The dataset contains 506 observations and 13 predictive features. These features are used to predict the median housing value in neighborhoods in the Boston Suburbs which can have heavy applications to real estate pricing. 
I decided to practice Regression Decision Tree Algorithms with this dataset to increase my practical understanding of the algorithm as well as its predictive behavior.

### Wine Quality Prediction: Regression Techniques (Python) 
[Github](https://github.com/steimel64/steimel64.github.io/blob/master/Notebooks/Wine.ipynb)

Wine is increasingly being enjoyed by consumers all around the globe. Quality is a very important factor for all consumers when choosing a product and thus a very important factor for finding the ideal wine to purchase.
Wouldn't it be interesting to be able to predict wine quality through some of its psyicochemical attributes? This project seeks to develop a model that helps the wine industry predict a wines quality through these factors with the most accuracy. For the purpose of this analysis, I will be utilizing the red wine dataset of Portugal to predict wine quality based on their physicochemical features.
 
I decided to practice new techniques like Cross-Validation and Hyperparameter tuning for this end-to-end Machine Learning project to improve my practical understanding of these techniques. 


## Natural language processing
Coming Soon! 

## Recommender Systems
[Github](https://github.com/steimel64/steimel64.github.io/blob/master/Notebooks/Anime%20Recommender/Recommender.ipynb)

My animelist.net is a popular site for viewing Anime online which is self proclaimed as the world's most active online anime and manga community and database. The Anime Recommendations database provided by animelist.net contains user review data from 76,000 users and wouldn't it be cool to generate some Recommendations based on this data? 

In this notebook I practiced building my first Collaborative Filtering Recommender System in Python with the K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm with pretty decent results. 


## Clustering
Coming Soon! 

## Neural networks
Coming Soon! 


## Data exploration and analysis

### Data Visualization/Exploration Project: Global Terrorism (Python) 
[Github](https://github.com/steimel64/steimel64.github.io/blob/master/Notebooks/Terrorism/Terrorism.ipynb)

The dataset comes from the Global Terrorism Database which details more than 170,000 terrorist attacks worldwide between 1970 and 2016.This project seeks to explore, visualize, and analyze terrorism Trends from a global perspective as well as from the perspective of Japan and the United States. I was able to apply various techniques for data exploration and map visualizations through Python.
